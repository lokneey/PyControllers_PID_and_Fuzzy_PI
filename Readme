This project shows comparison of classic PID controller and Fuzzed PI controller. Both controllers are designed to controll height of the liquid in tank where there is contolable inflow and constant outflow. Constants which were used during designing process was choosen to controll height of the liquid at 10 m. Script allows user to compare diagrams which represent signals in both automatic control systems. Values of last symulatin are also written into csv files.

Below you can see an example diagrams:

Fuzzed regulator is based in scikit-fuzzy library. All license statements of library work also in this project.
